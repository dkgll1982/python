　　　　In spring， the mother pig took the little pig LuLu to the foot of the mountain。 They planted some watermelon。　　When summer came， there were many big round watermelons in the field。　　One day， the sun was burning like a fire， it was terribly hot on the ground。 The mother pig said to the little pig：“Lulu， go to the field to pick a watermelon back，ok？” Lulu said happily：“Ok！ No problem。”　　Then he ran to the watermelon field。 When he got to the field， he was happy to find so many big green watermelons。 He chose one of the biggest watermelon and picked it from the vine。 Then he held it with his hands trying to lift is on his shoulder to carry it home。　　“Wow！It‘s so heavy！” Lulu tried several times， but he failed。 And he was socked with sweat。 He wiped his sweat off and decided to have a rest。　　Suddenly he saw the monkey Pipi。 He was playing with a hoop。 Lulu patted his head and said：“I‘ve got it。” He thought，the round hoop can roll， the watermelon round too，then it can roll too.He then put the big melon on the ground and rolled it forward quickly。　　At last he got home with the watermelon.The mother pig knew the story， she exclaimed：“My child， you‘re really clever！”　　小猪搬西瓜　　春天的时候，猪妈妈带着小猪噜噜，在山坡下种了一大片西瓜。到了夏天，西瓜地里结满了又圆又大的西瓜。　　有一天，太阳光火辣辣地照着大地，天啊，可热了。猪妈妈对小猪说：“噜噜，你到咱们的地里摘个大西瓜回来解解渴吧！”小猪噜噜高兴地说：“好吧！”说完就往西瓜地里跑。到了地里一看。呵，到处躺着大西瓜，水灵灵的，真惹人喜爱！噜噜挑了个最大的摘了下来。它双手搂着西瓜，想抱起来放在肩上扛回家。“哟，好重呀！”噜噜试着抱了几次都没有抱起来，还累得满头大汗。 它直起身来，擦了擦脸上的汗水想休息一下，再去试试抱西瓜。突然，它看到小猴皮皮在山下边的马路上滚铁环玩呢。小猪噜噜一拍后脑勺高兴地说：“有了，我有办法了。”什么办法呢？小猪噜噜心想：铁环是圆的，可以滚动。西瓜也是圆的，不也可以滚动吗？想到这儿啊，小猪噜噜顾不上休息，把大西瓜放在地上。咕噜噜，咕噜噜地向前滚，一直把西瓜滚到家里。　　猪妈妈看到小猪噜噜把又圆又大的西瓜搬回家，夸奖噜噜是个爱动脑筋的猪娃娃！　　来源：沪江英语
